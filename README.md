# react-personal-website-v2
This is my second version of my personal website built using ReactJS. I used Figma to envision how I wanted the website to look on different screen sizes. This design provides a functional e-mail form in the Contact section, and displays my downloadable resume in the Resume section. Visually, this version is much more colorful and engaging.

Below are images of my website as of November 24, 2021.

# November 24 Update
In the next update, I would like to add pages for each individual project in my Work section. For example, clicking on my Personal Website project will bring the user to a page that explains the project. Additionally, I would like to make the social media icons on the Home page fixed so they stay on the screen when the user scrolls.
